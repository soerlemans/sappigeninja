============
Who am I?:
---------
I am a 21 year old programmer from the Netherlands.
I have various hobbies outside of programming but I like to keep more personal info private.

I have a passion for programming and really like reading tech blogs and fidgeting with computers.
I like to program in the following languages (these are loosely in order of how often I use them):
- C++ (23/17/14/11)
- C
- Python3+
- Lisp
   - Common Lisp
   - Emacs Lisp
- Bash/Zsh

I have a website that I work on from time to time (its called [forestofunix](https://forestofunix.xyz)).

The best way to describe me is as the weird programming languages guy.

Software I use:
---------------
Software that I use frequently and why I use it.
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a ridiculously configurable ''text editor'', I could not live without it.
- [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/) ahead of the curve since 1960!
- [gawk](https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=gawk) I dont really use AWK daily but I think it is a really well designed little language that does what it is supposed to do.
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) rofi is an application launcher, extremely handy for shell scripting purposes.
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is an excellent terminal emulator, sadly not as configurable as I would like.
